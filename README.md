I just completed Accenture North America's Data Analytics and Visualization on Forage. In the simulation I: 

- Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture 
- Cleaned, modelled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
- Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
